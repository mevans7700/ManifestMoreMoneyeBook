Over the yearsI have discovered that attracting and allowing desires in your life, especially money desires, is really not that hard; unless it is.  It appears hard because sometimes we are faced with a shift in our money energy and that shift often calls forth the opposite of what we want.

We experience money challenges, or fear, or uncertainty, or major expenses that can weaken that money muscle you have been building.

You will discover that an expanding money experience in your life is the result of how consistent you are with your thoughts, words, feelings and actions and how they align with the vibration of your money desires.

This is where dealing with the opposites becomes so important.  Don't let the opposites change that flow... in fact I dare you to let it strengthen and increase it.

I believe that when you do this kind of work in your life you'll release old energies that no longer serve you.  When you release them they will often bring back a like energy in the form of an 'opposite.'

Have you ever heard....

What you resist persists...
what you look at disappears.

If you see an opposite as something that should NOT be happening, then you'll be feeding it what it wants - its like energy; once again making it a part of your money story.  If you look at it with a sense of curosity and knowing that you are about to shift in some minor or major way, then that opposite will actually serve you.  You'll grow and your money muscle will be stronger.  I hope this helps. That's it for now.  Let's continue online :)  ~ Robert
